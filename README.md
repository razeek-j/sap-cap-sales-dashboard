## üéØ Project Goal & Learning Journey

This project was undertaken as a self-learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with modern, full-stack development within the SAP ecosystem, specifically targeting the skills required for a role focused on applying AI in enterprise software.

This project was originally architected with an ABAP RAP backend. However, a persistent authorization block in the trial environment made that approach unfeasible. To overcome this technical hurdle, I re-implemented the backend using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), successfully connecting it to the same Fiori front-end to complete the full-stack application.
