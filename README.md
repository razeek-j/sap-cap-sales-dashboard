## üéØ Project Goal & Learning Journey

This project was undertaken as a self-learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with modern, full-stack development within the SAP ecosystem, specifically targeting the skills required for a role focused on applying AI in enterprise software.

Initially, this project was started using the **ABAP RESTful Application Programming (RAP)** model to build the backend service. However, due to persistent, unresolvable authorization issues within the SAP BTP trial environment, a strategic pivot was made.

Instead of being blocked, I adapted by choosing to build the exact same application using the **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)**. This journey demonstrates key problem-solving skills, resilience in the face of technical roadblocks, and the ability to quickly learn an alternative, strategic framework within the same ecosystem to achieve the project's objective.
